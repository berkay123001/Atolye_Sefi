- **Resource Monitoring** - Memory, CPU limits
- **Persistent Sessions** - Keep variables between runs
- **Multi-language Support** - JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.
- **Debugging Support** - Breakpoints, step-through
- **Package Management** - Auto pip install

**Professional Gap: 60%** (Basic execution, no safety/debugging)

## 📁 **ENHANCED_FILE_OPS (File Operations)**

### ✅ **Current Status (Advanced):**
- File read/write operations
- Directory monitoring (watchdog)
- Bulk file operations (100+ files)
- Path validation and safety

### 🎯 **Full Professional Features (Minor Missing):**
- **Version Control Integration** - Git hooks on file changes
- **Backup & Recovery** - Auto snapshots
- **File Templates** - Boilerplate generation
- **Content Search & Replace** - Regex across files

**Professional Gap: 20%** (Already quite professional)

## 🚀 **PRIORITY ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Core Professional (2-3 weeks)**
1. **GitPython Integration** (1 week)
2. **Code Quality Tools** (1 week)  
3. **Jedi Smart Features** (3-4 days)

### **Phase 2: Advanced Professional (1-2 months)**
1. **Sandboxed Execution** (2 weeks)
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture** (3-4 weeks)
3. **Advanced Code Intelligence** (1-2 weeks)

### **Phase 3: Enterprise Professional (2-3 months)**
1. **Learning & Adaptation** 
2. **Team Collaboration Features**
3. **Enterprise Security & Compliance**

---

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **✅ Strong Foundation:**
- Context awareness is near-professional
- File operations are solid
- Basic execution works

### **❌ Critical Gaps:**
- No Git integration (huge for developers)
- No code quality enforcement
- Limited code intelligence
- No security/sandboxing

### **🎯 Recommendation:**
**Next Priority: GitPython Integration** - Biggest professional impact for effort invested.

---

**Bottom Line:** We have a solid foundation (43% professional), but missing key developer workflow tools. GitPython would boost us to ~65% professional level.
